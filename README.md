Penman-Monteith is a well-known method for estimating evapotranspiration, which is an important factor in many agricultural and 
environmental applications. The Penman-Monteith method takes into account various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, 
wind speed, and solar radiation to estimate the amount of water that is lost through evapotranspiration.
